# Weather App
A beginners app where I can learn and keep track of its development, hopefully making it not so basic in the future.

Todo:
- [X] Functioning Weather App
- [X] OpenWeatherMap API Implemented
- [X] Unsplash API Implemented for random background image per request 
- [ ] Dark Mode Toggle
- [ ] More Themes?
- [X] Moved Sensitive Information to .env which is added to .gitignore

This is my journey into web development. It may look easy and poorly done, but it's more for my benefit than anyone else's. Everyone has to start somewhere, right?

Note: This repository may contain old API keys. These have been revoked, and new ones have been created that are now secret >_<
